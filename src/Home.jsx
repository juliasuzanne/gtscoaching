          <br></br>I understand that leaving college friends behind, facing job search pressures, and managing parental
          expectations can be overwhelming. That's why I offer personalized coaching that focuses on both mindset and
          action. I help my clients develop essential executive functioning skills, find balance between their personal
          and professional lives, and reduce stress through practical strategies. My goal is to position each client for
          success by equipping them with the tools they need to thrive in their new chapters.
